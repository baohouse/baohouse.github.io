## Vietnamese American Youth Development
I am particularly interested in Vietnamese American youth development in Northern California.

### Focuses
- Community and personal history
- Creative self-expression
- Project organizing and community advocacy
- Social connections and cultural sharing

### Current philanthropic investments
- [Tet San Jose](http://www.tetsanjose.org) Táº¿t is the Vietnamese New Year, and this event in San Jose is organized by Vietnamese youths.[\[1\]](#1)
  - 2015: General fund
- [UNAVSA Conference](http://conference.unavsa.org) Brings together Vietnamese youths from North America for a 4-day conference.[\[2\]](#2)
  - 2014 (UNAVSA-11 Dallas): General fund
  - 2015 (UNAVSA-12 Seattle): General fund
- [NorCal UVSA Summit](http://summit.norcaluvsa.org) Brings college students and recent graduates from campuses across Northern California (primarily ones that have a VSA).
  - 2014: 11 scholarships to cover registration; general programming fund
  - 2015: 9 scholarships to cover registration
- [Mid-Autumn Youth Summit (MAYS)](https://www.facebook.com/events/474512559395601) Brings together high school VSAs in Santa Clara County for a day of cultural activities.
  - 2015: Scholarship prizes for essay, speech, and quiz competitions.
- [Southeast Asian Resource Action Center (SEARAC)](http://www.searac.org) A national NGO focused on advocacy, leadership development, and capacity-building for Southeast Asian Americans.[\[3\]](#3)
  - 2015: General fund
- [Black April Commemoration](http://www.varoundtable.org) Hosted by the Vietnamese American Roundtable (VAR), this event is dedicated to April 30 as a  remembrance day for the Vietnamese American diaspora experience. It is notable that this event is organized mostly by young professionals.
  - 2015: General fund

### Endnotes
- [1] I will want to start splitting up the donation and earmark some of it for staff development, which right now is almost nonexistent.
- [2] I've donated to UNAVSA Conference general fund in order for it to stay nimble and use the money were needed. I will consider splitting the fund in the future for both general purposes and for an attendance scholarshp for a youth from Northern California to attend.
- [3] SEARAC focuses on Southeast Asian Americans, not specifically Vietnamese Americans. Also, I donated to its general fund so that it can stay nimble. In the future I may set up an external scholarship to subsidize a youth from Northern California to attend their Leadership Advocacy Training (LAT) program, particularly ones who have interest in advocating for the Vietnamese American community.
