### Endnotes
- [1] I've donated to UNAVSA Conference general fund in order for it to stay nimble and use the money were needed. I will consider splitting the fund in the future for both general purposes and for an attendance scholarshp for a youth from Northern California to attend.
- [2] SEARAC focuses on Southeast Asian Americans, not specifically Vietnamese Americans. Also, I donated to its general fund so that it can stay nimble. In the future I may set up an external scholarship to subsidize a youth from Northern California to attend their Leadership Advocacy Training (LAT) program, particularly ones who have interest in advocating the Vietnamese American community.
