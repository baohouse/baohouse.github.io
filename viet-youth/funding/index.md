title: Vietnamese Youth Group Funding
---

By Bảo Thiên Ngô

Funding a youth/student organization is a fundamental skill. The difficulty is figuring out what is the most optimal strategy to support plenty of programming for the members and community-at-large.

My knowledge thus stems from observations over years, starting at UCLA where I was involved in both the Vietnamese Student Union (VSU) as a historian, and the Vietnamese Language & Culture (VNLC) group. Following UCLA I moved back to Northern California and helped with the formation of the new United Vietnamese Student Associations of Northern California (NorCal UVSA). A few of us then helped organize the third conference of the Union of North American Vietnamese Student Association (UNAVSA) held in San Jose. I've helped out with a few conferences following that.

In 2010, I served as Co-Executive Director of the Children's Moon Festival, essentially the Vietnamese Mid-Autumn Festival celebrated in San Jose. I then went to join up with colleagues at EM Radio (a Vietnamese youth-led radio programming in San Jose) and formed the CayDa Foundation to focus on infrastructure for Vietnamese youths to organize outside of the college campus. My colleagues (both inside and outside of CayDa) bootstrapped the Vietnamese American Roundtable, something we all envisioned: that every club/group/organization is like a village, and that to have a strong nation, every village should be given chances to flourish and grow according to their unique circumstances, and that the roundtable was a way to create a forum for mutual support.

My CayDa colleague Quyen Mai eventually went on to become the Executive Director of Vietnamese Voluntary Foundation (VIVO), an organization which was founded in 1979. In comparison to the wholly new CayDa Foundation, the board members and I agreed to have VIVO be the visionary successor and put CayDa into hibernation in order to reduce administrative overhead. In the meantime I've focused on my career and started thinking about young professional involvement in the Vietnamese American community. I've just begun participating with the Vietnamese American Entrepreneur Network (VAEN).

One of the more interesting funding strategies I've first observed at UCLA was the existence of multiple Vietnamese groups, each of them supported by funding from the university and student government. The reason for this was that the funding pools had certain restrictions and requirements. Some funds were to be used for diversity. Some were to be used for community development. Some were part of the general student group funds. The history of UCLA's Vietnamese student organizations is quite interesting in that regard.

Before the current UCLA Vietnamese Student Union, there was the Vietnamese Student Assocation founded in 1977, and the Vietnamese Refugee Aid Committee (VRAC) formed in 1978 under VSA, and only later split off into its own group. My hypothesis was that this was possible due to the way the funding pool was structured, and that there were enough leadership capacity to support two independent groups. It would be many years later until the two groups merge again. There isn't any record of the reason for this, but as a lot of mergers are done out of practicality, I suspect the reason was largely because of administrative overhead. By shuffling people out of admin roles, you can put more of them into project development roles, e.g. why have two treasurers when you can have one, and the other helps out with project logistics?

And then in 1994, Vietnamese Language & Culture (VNLC) formed, and they focused on Vietnamese culture. And in 2004, the Vietnamese Community Health Project (VHCP) formed, which focused on health.

I have observed this concept again at UC Davis, where there is a VSA and a Vietnamese Cancer Awareness, Research and Education Society (VNCARES). VNCARES would later encourage the formation of a chapter at the University of Pacific, so they too have both a VSA and VNCARES. And for Stanford University, there not only exists a VSA, but also a Vietnamese dance group called Múa Lạc Hồng.

What is the lesson here? If the leadership capacity is there and the funding pool is structured to allow for it, it's possible to have multiple Vietnamese student groups. One concern, however, is if there are two groups applying for the same funding pool. In those situations, avoid having officers that serve in both groups, for that would start to look like you're double-dipping.

The other concern is that instead of building this sense of one unified Vietnamese community, you have different "factions". However, this sense of disconnect is only an illusion. In reality, all groups are open to everyone, so it's possible for members to be involved in more than one group (as I have). Second, the disconnect would exist if none of the groups talk to each other. But in my knowledge of UCLA, there was always a line of communication among the leadership among all groups to understand each group's specialty. VSU focused on student government, coalition-building, and the culture show; VNLC focused on culture such as the Vietnamese New Year and Vietnamese language education; and VHCP focused on community development. It was almost a kind of informal forum, and out of that was a mutual understanding that all groups are driven to provide for the prosperity, health, and holistic development of the Vietnamese community. If there WAS any beef, it's only between individuals.
